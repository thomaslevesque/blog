	<div class="content list__excerpt post__content clearfix">
		The problem If you often use HttpClient to call REST APIs or to transfer files, you may have been annoyed by the way this class handles request timeout. There are two major issues with timeout handling in HttpClient:
 The timeout is defined at the HttpClient level and applies to all requests made with this HttpClient; it would be more convenient to be able to specify a timeout individually for each request.

		T4 (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) is a great tool to generate code at design time; you can, for instance, create POCO classes from database tables, generate repetitive code, etc. In Visual Studio, T4 files (.tt extension) are associated with the TextTemplatingFileGenerator custom tool, which transforms the template to generate an output file every time you save the template. But sometimes it&rsquo;s not enough, and you want to ensure that the template&rsquo;s output is regenerated before build.

		To be honest, I never really liked MSBuild until recently. The project files generated by Visual Studio were a mess, most of their content was redundant, you had to unload the projects to edit them, it was poorly documented&hellip; But with the advent of .NET Core and the new &ldquo;SDK-style&rdquo; projects, it&rsquo;s become much, much better.
MSBuild 15 introduced a pretty cool feature: implicit imports (I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the official name, but I&rsquo;ll use it anyway).

		I&rsquo;ve been meaning to blog about LINQPad in a very long time. In case you don&rsquo;t know about it, LINQPad is a tool that lets you write and test code very quickly without having to create a full-blown project in Visual Studio. It supports C#, VB.NET, F# and SQL. It was initially intended as an educational tool to experiment with LINQ (its author, Joe Albahari, developed it as companion to his C# in a Nutshell book), but it&rsquo;s also extremely useful as a general-purpose .

	<div class="content list__excerpt post__content clearfix">
		By now, you&rsquo;re probably aware that Microsoft released an open-source and cross-platform version of the .NET platform: .NET Core. This means you can now build and run .NET apps on Linux or macOS. This is pretty cool in itself, but it doesn&rsquo;t end there: .NET Core also brings a lot of improvements to the Base Class Library.
For instance, Linq has been made faster in .NET Core. I made a little benchmark to compare the performance of some common Linq methods, and the results are quite impressive:

			Easy text parsing in C# with Sprache

	<div class="content list__excerpt post__content clearfix">
		A few days ago, I discovered a little gem: Sprache. The name means &ldquo;language&rdquo; in German. It&rsquo;s a very elegant and easy to use library to create text parsers, using parser combinators, which are a very common technique in functional programming. The theorical concept may seem a bit scary, but as you&rsquo;ll see in a minute, Sprache makes it very simple.
Text parsing Parsing text is a common task, but it can be tedious and error-prone.

		FakeItEasy is a popular mocking framework for .NET, with an very intuitive and easy-to-use API. For about one year, I&rsquo;ve been a maintainer of FakeItEasy, along with Adam Ralph and Blair Conrad. It&rsquo;s been a real pleasure working with them and I had a lot of fun!
Today I&rsquo;m glad to announce that we&rsquo;re releasing FakeItEasy 3.0.0, which supports .NET Core and introduces a few useful features.
Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s new!

		If you use git on the command line, you may have noticed that diff hunks often show the method signature in the hunk header (the line that starts with @@), like this:
diff --git a/Program.cs b/Program.cs index 655a213..5ae1016 100644 --- a/Program.cs +++ b/Program.cs @@ -13,6 +13,7 @@ static void Main(string[] args)  Console.WriteLine(&#34;Hello World!&#34;); Console.WriteLine(&#34;Hello World!&#34;); Console.WriteLine(&#34;Hello World!&#34;); + Console.WriteLine(&#34;blah&#34;);  } This is very useful to know where you are when looking at a diff.

		A few years ago, Microsoft introduced the HttpClient class as a modern alternative to HttpWebRequest to make web requests from .NET apps. Not only is this new API much easier to use, cleaner, and asynchronous by design, it&rsquo;s also easily extensible.
You might have noticed that HttpClient has a constructor that accepts a HttpMessageHandler. What is this handler? It&rsquo;s an object that accepts a request (HttpRequestMessage) and returns a response (HttpResponseMessage); how it does that is entirely dependent on the implementation.

		Last time on this blog I talked about the new tuple feature of C# 7. In Visual Studio 15 Preview 3, the feature wasn’t quite finished; it lacked 2 important aspects:
  emitting metadata for the names of tuple elements, so that the names are preserved across assemblies
  deconstruction of tuples into separate variables
Well, it looks like the C# language team has been busy during the last month, because both items are now implemented in VS 15 Preview 4, which was released today!
