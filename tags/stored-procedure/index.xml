      <description>Disclaimer: I am by no mean a TypeScript expert. In fact, I know very little about JS, npm, gulp, etc. So it&amp;rsquo;s entirely possible I said something really stupid in this article, or maybe I missed a much simpler way of doing things. Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to let me know in the comments!&#xA;Azure Cosmos DB (formerly known as Azure Document DB) is a NoSQL, multi-model, globally-distributed database hosted in Azure. If you come from relational SQL databases, it&amp;rsquo;s a very different world.</description>
