      <description>Out of the box, ASP.NET Core has the concept of &amp;ldquo;environments&amp;rdquo;, which allows your app to use different settings based on which environment it&amp;rsquo;s running in. For instance, you can have Development/Staging/Production environments, each with its own settings file, and a common settings file shared by all environments:
 appsettings.json: global settings appsettings.Development.json: settings specific to the Development environment appsettings.Staging.json: settings specific to the Staging environment appsettings.Production.json: settings specific to the Production environment  With the default configuration, environment-specific settings just override global settings, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to specify unchanged settings in every environment if they&amp;rsquo;re already specified in the global settings file.</description>
