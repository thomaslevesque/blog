      <description>Just a quick tip today!
for and foreach loops are among the most useful constructs in a C# developer&amp;rsquo;s toolbox. To iterate a collection, foreach is, in my opinion, more convenient than for in most cases. It works with all collection types, including those that are not indexable such as IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require to access the current element by its index.
But sometimes, you do need the index of the current item; this usually leads to one of these patterns:</description>

      <description>By now, you&amp;rsquo;re probably aware that Microsoft released an open-source and cross-platform version of the .NET platform: .NET Core. This means you can now build and run .NET apps on Linux or macOS. This is pretty cool in itself, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there: .NET Core also brings a lot of improvements to the Base Class Library.
For instance, Linq has been made faster in .NET Core. I made a little benchmark to compare the performance of some common Linq methods, and the results are quite impressive:</description>

      <title>Optimize ToArray and ToList by providing the number of elements</title>

      <description>The ToArray and ToList extension methods are convenient ways to eagerly materialize an enumerable sequence (e.g. a Linq query) into an array or a list. However, there’s something that bothers me: both of these methods are very inefficient if they don’t know the number of elements in the sequence (which is almost always the case when you use them on a Linq query). Let’s focus on ToArray for now (ToList has a few differences, but the principle is mostly the same).</description>

      <title>[WPF] Using Linq to shape data in a CollectionView</title>

      <description>WPF provides a simple mechanism for shaping collections of data, via the ICollectionView interface and its Filter, SortDescriptions and GroupDescriptions properties:
// Collection to which the view is bound public ObservableCollection People { get; private set; } ... // Default view of the People collection ICollectionView view = CollectionViewSource.GetDefaultView(People); // Show only adults view.Filter = o =&amp;gt; ((Person)o).Age &amp;gt;= 18; // Sort by last name and first name view.SortDescriptions.Add(new SortDescription(&amp;#34;LastName&amp;#34;, ListSortDirection.</description>

      <title>[Entity Framework] Using Include with lambda expressions</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a project that uses Entity Framework 4. Even though lazy loading is enabled, I often use the ObjectQuery.Include method to eagerly load associated entities, in order to avoid database roundtrips when I access them:
var query = from ord in db.Orders.Include(&amp;#34;OrderDetails&amp;#34;) where ord.Date &amp;gt;= DateTime.Today select ord; Or if I also want to eagerly load the product:
var query = from ord in db.Orders.Include(&amp;#34;OrderDetails.Product&amp;#34;) where ord.Date &amp;gt;= DateTime.</description>

      <title>Automating null checks with Linq expressions</title>

      <description>The problem Have you ever written code like the following ?
X xx = GetX(); string name = &amp;#34;Default&amp;#34;; if (xx != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; xx.Foo != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; xx.Foo.Bar != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; xx.Foo.Bar.Baz != null) { name = xx.Foo.Bar.Baz.Name; } I bet you have ! You just need to get the value of xx.Foo.Bar.Baz.Name, but you have to test every intermediate object to ensure that it&amp;rsquo;s not null. It can quickly become annoying if the property you need is nested in a deep object graph&amp;hellip;.</description>
