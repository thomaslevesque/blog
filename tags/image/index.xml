      <description>WPF’s RichTextBox control is quite powerful, and very handy if you need to accept rich text input. However, one of its features can become an issue: the user can paste an image. Depending on what you intend to do with the text entered by the user, you might not want that.
When I googled for a way to prevent that, the only solutions I found suggested to intercept the Ctrl-V keystroke, and swallow the event if the clipboard contains an image.</description>

      <description>Today I ran into a strange problem that made me waste an hour or two, so I thought I’d write about it in case someone else faces the same issue.
The SearchBox control was introduced in Windows 8.1 to enable search scenarios from within a Windows Store app. One of its features is that it can show suggestions based on user input. There are three kinds of suggestions:
 History suggestions are search queries previously entered by the user.</description>

      <description>Oops&amp;hellip; 2 months already since my previous (and first) post&amp;hellip; I really have to get on a more regular schedule ;)
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to use the Clipboard.GetImage method in WPF, you probably had an unpleasant surprise&amp;hellip; In fact, this method returns an InteropBitmap which, in some cases (most cases actually), can&amp;rsquo;t be displayed in an Image control : no exception is thrown, the image size is correct, but the image either appears empty or unrecognizable.</description>
