      <description>With the release of .NET 10 just around the corner (next month!), it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a look at the new features we can expect for C# 14.&#xA;Note: the goal of this post is not to be an exhaustive list of all new features. I will only cover the ones that seem the most interesting to me. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the features I don&amp;rsquo;t mention are useless, but they just have more niche use cases so they probably won&amp;rsquo;t have as much impact on most developers.</description>

      <description>If you use git on the command line, you may have noticed that diff hunks often show the method signature in the hunk header (the line that starts with @@), like this:&#xA;diff --git a/Program.cs b/Program.cs index 655a213..5ae1016 100644 --- a/Program.cs +++ b/Program.cs @@ -13,6 +13,7 @@ static void Main(string[] args) Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;); Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;); Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;); + Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;blah&amp;#34;); } This is very useful to know where you are when looking at a diff.</description>
