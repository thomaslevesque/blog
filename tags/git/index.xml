      <title>Cleanup Git history to remove unwanted files</title>

      <description>I recently had to work with a Git repository whose modifications needed to be ported to another repo. Unfortunately, the repo had been created without a .gitignore file, so a lot of useless files (bin/obj/packages directories&amp;hellip;) had been commited. This made the history hard to follow, because each commit had hundreds of modified files.
Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s rather easy with Git to cleanup a branch, by recreating the same commits without the files that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been there in the first place.</description>

      <description>If you use git on the command line, you may have noticed that diff hunks often show the method signature in the hunk header (the line that starts with @@), like this:
diff --git a/Program.cs b/Program.cs index 655a213..5ae1016 100644 --- a/Program.cs +++ b/Program.cs @@ -13,6 +13,7 @@ static void Main(string[] args)  Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;); Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;); Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;); + Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;blah&amp;#34;);  } This is very useful to know where you are when looking at a diff.</description>

      <title>Visual Studio Online &#43; Git integration with Team Explorer</title>

      <description>I recently started using Visual Studio Online for personal projects, and I must say it’s a pretty good platform, although it would be nice to be able to host public projects as well as private ones. The thing I like the most is the integration with Visual Studio Team Explorer to manage work items and builds.
However, I noticed a little gotcha when using Git for source control : the remote for VS Online must be named origin, otherwise Team Explorer won’t detect that it’s a VS Online project, and it won’t show the “Builds” and “Work items” pages.</description>
