      <description>A few years ago, Microsoft introduced the HttpClient class as a modern alternative to HttpWebRequest to make web requests from .NET apps. Not only is this new API much easier to use, cleaner, and asynchronous by design, it&amp;rsquo;s also easily extensible.&#xA;You might have noticed that HttpClient has a constructor that accepts a HttpMessageHandler. What is this handler? It&amp;rsquo;s an object that accepts a request (HttpRequestMessage) and returns a response (HttpResponseMessage); how it does that is entirely dependent on the implementation.</description>
