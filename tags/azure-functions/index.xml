      <description>I recently experimented with Azure Functions and GitHub apps, and I wanted to share what I learned.
A bit of background As you may already know, I&amp;rsquo;m one of the maintainers of the FakeItEasy mocking library. As is common in open-source projects, we use a workflow based on feature branches and pull requests. When a change is requested in a PR during code review, we usually make the change as a fixup commit, because it makes it easier to review, and because we like to keep a clean history.</description>
