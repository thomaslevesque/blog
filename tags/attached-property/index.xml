      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a trick that I used quite often in the past few months. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that in order to improve the look of your application, you created custom styles for the standard controls:&#xA;OK, I&amp;rsquo;m not a designer&amp;hellip; but it will serve the purpose well enough to illustrate my point ;). These styles are very simple, they&amp;rsquo;re just the default styles of CheckBox and RadioButton in which I only changed the templates to replace the BulletChromes with these awesome blue tick marks.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I wrote a post where I explained how to automatically sort a GridView when a column header is clicked. I had mentioned a possible improvement : add a sort glyph in the column header to show which column is sorted. In today&amp;rsquo;s post, I present a new version of the GridViewSort class, which displays the sort glyph.&#xA;To achieve this result, I used an Adorner : this is a component which allows to draw over existing UI elements, on an independant rendering layer.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple, in WPF, to present data in a grid, thanks to the GridView class. If you want to sort it, however, it gets a little harder&amp;hellip; With the DataGridView in Windows Forms, it was &amp;ldquo;automagic&amp;rdquo; : when the user clicked a column header, the grid was automatically sorted. To achieve the same behavior in WPF, you need to get your hands dirty&amp;hellip; The method recommended by Microsoft is described in this article ; it is based on the Click event of the GridViewColumnHeader class.</description>
