      <description>Last time on this blog I talked about the new tuple feature of C# 7. In Visual Studio 15 Preview 3, the feature wasnâ€™t quite finished; it lacked 2 important aspects:
  emitting metadata for the names of tuple elements, so that the names are preserved across assemblies
  deconstruction of tuples into separate variables
Well, it looks like the C# language team has been busy during the last month, because both items are now implemented in VS 15 Preview 4, which was released today!</description>
