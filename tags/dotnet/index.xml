      <description>With the release of .NET 10 just around the corner (next month!), it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a look at the new features we can expect for C# 14.&#xA;Note: the goal of this post is not to be an exhaustive list of all new features. I will only cover the ones that seem the most interesting to me. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the features I don&amp;rsquo;t mention are useless, but they just have more niche use cases so they probably won&amp;rsquo;t have as much impact on most developers.</description>
