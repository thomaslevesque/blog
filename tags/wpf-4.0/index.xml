      <description>THE feature that was missing from WPF ! Visual Studio 2010 beta 2 has been released last week, and it brings to WPF a long awaited feature : support for bindings in InputBindings. As a reminder, the issue in previous releases was that the Command property of the InputBinding class wasn&amp;rsquo;t a DependencyProperty, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to bind it. Furthermore, InputBindings didn&amp;rsquo;t inherit the parent DataContext, which made it difficult to provide alternative implementations&amp;hellip; Until now, in order to bind the Command of a KeyBinding or MouseBinding to a property of the DataContext, we had to resort to clumsy workarounds&amp;hellip; I had eventually came up with an acceptable solution, described in this post, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really satisfied with it (it used reflection on private members, and had annoying limitations).</description>
