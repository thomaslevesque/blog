      <description>Cloudflare Workers Cloudflare Workers is a serverless environment that runs Javascript. Basically, you just write code that handle HTTP requests, similarly to Node.js. The code is deployed globally across the Cloudflare network, which means it&amp;rsquo;s always running as close as possible to the end user.&#xA;I was recently playing with Cloudflare Workers to see how it worked, and I realized how incredibly easy it was to make a simple URL shortener with it!</description>
