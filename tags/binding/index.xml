      <description>Today I’d like to share a trick I used while developing my first Windows Store application. I’m very new to this technology and it’s my first article about it, so I hope I won’t make a fool of myself…
It’s often useful to be notified when the value of a dependency property changes; many controls expose events for that purpose, but it’s not always the case. For instance, recently I was trying to detect when the Content property of a ContentControl changed.</description>

      <description>The DataContext property in WPF is extremely handy, because it is automatically inherited by all children of the element where you assign it; therefore you don&amp;rsquo;t need to set it again on each element you want to bind. However, in some cases the DataContext is not accessible: it happens for elements that are not part of the visual or logical tree. It can be very difficult then to bind a property on those elements&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>[VS2010] Binding support in InputBindings</title>

      <description>THE feature that was missing from WPF ! Visual Studio 2010 beta 2 has been released last week, and it brings to WPF a long awaited feature : support for bindings in InputBindings.
As a reminder, the issue in previous releases was that the Command property of the InputBinding class wasn&amp;rsquo;t a DependencyProperty, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to bind it. Furthermore, InputBindings didn&amp;rsquo;t inherit the parent DataContext, which made it difficult to provide alternative implementations&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>[WPF] Binding to an asynchronous collection</title>

      <description>As you may have noticed, it is not possible to modify the contents of an ObservableCollection on a separate thread if a view is bound to this collection : the CollectionView raises a NotSupportedException :
 This type of CollectionView does not support changes to its SourceCollection from a thread different from the Dispatcher thread
 To illustrate this, let&amp;rsquo;s take a simple example : a ListBox bound to a collection of strings in the ViewModel :</description>

      <description>Hi, this is my first post on this blog, I hope you will enjoy it ;-). If you want to know a few things about me, please check out this page.
The end-user of any application expects that his preferences (window size, state of this or that option&amp;hellip;) are saved to be restored at the next run : that&amp;rsquo;s why .NET 2.0 introduced application settings as a unified way to persist these settings.</description>
