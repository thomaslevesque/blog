      <description>Over the last few years, OpenID Connect has become one of the most common ways to authenticate users in a web application. But if you want to use it in a desktop application, it can be a little awkward…
Authorization code flow OpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, which means that you have to use one of the OAuth 2.0 authorization flows. A few years ago, there were basically two possible flows that you could use in a desktop client application to authenticate a user:</description>

      <description>The problem with circular dependencies When building an application, good design dictates that you should avoid circular dependencies between your services. A circular dependency is when some components depend on each other, directly or indirectly, e.g. A depends on B which depends on C which depends on A:
It is generally agreed that this should be avoided; I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the details of the conceptual and theoretical reasons, because there are plenty of resources about it on the web.</description>

      <description>Query strings are typically made of a sequence of key-value pairs, like ?foo=hello&amp;amp;bar=world…. However, if you look at RFC 3986, you can see that query strings are very loosely specified. It mentions that
 query components are often used to carry identifying information in the form of &amp;ldquo;key=value&amp;rdquo; pairs
 But it&amp;rsquo;s just an observation, not a rule (RFCs usually have very specific wording for rules, with words like MUST, SHOULD, etc.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core: when environments are not enough, use sub-environments!</title>

      <description>Out of the box, ASP.NET Core has the concept of &amp;ldquo;environments&amp;rdquo;, which allows your app to use different settings based on which environment it&amp;rsquo;s running in. For instance, you can have Development/Staging/Production environments, each with its own settings file, and a common settings file shared by all environments:
 appsettings.json: global settings appsettings.Development.json: settings specific to the Development environment appsettings.Staging.json: settings specific to the Staging environment appsettings.Production.json: settings specific to the Production environment  With the default configuration, environment-specific settings just override global settings, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to specify unchanged settings in every environment if they&amp;rsquo;re already specified in the global settings file.</description>

      <title>Easy unit testing of null argument validation (C# 8 edition)</title>

      <description>A few years ago, I blogged about a way to automate unit testing of null argument validation. Its usage looked like this:
[Fact] public void FullOuterJoin_Throws_If_Argument_Is_Null() { var left = Enumerable.Empty&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(); var right = Enumerable.Empty&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(); TestHelper.AssertThrowsWhenArgumentNull( () =&amp;gt; left.FullOuterJoin(right, x =&amp;gt; x, y =&amp;gt; y, (k, x, y) =&amp;gt; 0, 0, 0, null), &amp;#34;left&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;leftKeySelector&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;rightKeySelector&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;resultSelector&amp;#34;); } Basically, for each of the specified parameters, the AssertThrowsWhenArgumentNull method rewrites the lambda expression by replacing the corresponding argument with null, compiles and executes it, and checks that it throws an ArgumentNullException with the appropriate parameter name.</description>

      <description>Just a quick tip today!
for and foreach loops are among the most useful constructs in a C# developer&amp;rsquo;s toolbox. To iterate a collection, foreach is, in my opinion, more convenient than for in most cases. It works with all collection types, including those that are not indexable such as IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require to access the current element by its index.
But sometimes, you do need the index of the current item; this usually leads to one of these patterns:</description>

      <description>If you use Azure AD authentication and want to allow users from any tenant to connect to your ASP.NET Core application, you need to configure the Azure AD app as multi-tenant, and use a &amp;ldquo;wildcard&amp;rdquo; tenant id such as organizations or common in the authority URL:
openIdConnectOptions.Authority = &amp;#34;https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/v2.0&amp;#34;; The problem when you do that is that with the default configuration, the token validation will fail because the issuer in the token won&amp;rsquo;t match the issuer specified in the OpenID metadata.</description>

      <description>Initialization in ASP.NET Core is a bit awkward. There are well defined places for registering services (the Startup.ConfigureServices method) and for building the middleware pipeline (the Startup.Configure method), but not for performing other initialization steps (e.g. pre-loading data, seeding a database, etc.).
Using a middleware: not such a good idea Two months ago I published a blog post about asynchronous initialization of an ASP.NET Core app using a custom middleware. At the time I was rather pleased with my solution, but a comment from Frantisek made me realize it wasn&amp;rsquo;t such a good approach.</description>

 Embed the image bytes as base64 in the JSON payload, e.g.  { &amp;#34;title&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;My first blog post&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;body&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;This is going to be the best blog EVER!</description>

Sometimes you need to perform some initialization steps when your web application starts. However, putting such code in the Startup.Configure method is generally not a good idea, because:
 There&amp;rsquo;s no current scope in the Configure method, so you can&amp;rsquo;t use services registered with &amp;ldquo;scoped&amp;rdquo; lifetime (this would throw an InvalidOperationException: Cannot resolve scoped service &amp;lsquo;MyApp.</description>

      <description>Middlewhat? The ASP.NET Core architecture features a system of middleware, which are pieces of code that handle requests and responses. Middleware are chained to each other to form a pipeline. Incoming requests are passed through the pipeline, where each middleware has a chance to do something with them before passing them to the next middleware. Outgoing responses are also passed through the pipeline, in reverse order. If this sounds very abstract, the following schema from the official ASP.</description>

      <description>The problem If you often use HttpClient to call REST APIs or to transfer files, you may have been annoyed by the way this class handles request timeout. There are two major issues with timeout handling in HttpClient:
 The timeout is defined at the HttpClient level and applies to all requests made with this HttpClient; it would be more convenient to be able to specify a timeout individually for each request.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to blog about LINQPad in a very long time. In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know about it, LINQPad is a tool that lets you write and test code very quickly without having to create a full-blown project in Visual Studio. It supports C#, VB.NET, F# and SQL. It was initially intended as an educational tool to experiment with LINQ (its author, Joe Albahari, developed it as companion to his C# in a Nutshell book), but it&amp;rsquo;s also extremely useful as a general-purpose .</description>

      <description>By now, you&amp;rsquo;re probably aware that Microsoft released an open-source and cross-platform version of the .NET platform: .NET Core. This means you can now build and run .NET apps on Linux or macOS. This is pretty cool in itself, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there: .NET Core also brings a lot of improvements to the Base Class Library.
For instance, Linq has been made faster in .NET Core. I made a little benchmark to compare the performance of some common Linq methods, and the results are quite impressive:</description>

      <description>A few years ago, Microsoft introduced the HttpClient class as a modern alternative to HttpWebRequest to make web requests from .NET apps. Not only is this new API much easier to use, cleaner, and asynchronous by design, it&amp;rsquo;s also easily extensible.
You might have noticed that HttpClient has a constructor that accepts a HttpMessageHandler. What is this handler? It&amp;rsquo;s an object that accepts a request (HttpRequestMessage) and returns a response (HttpResponseMessage); how it does that is entirely dependent on the implementation.</description>

  emitting metadata for the names of tuple elements, so that the names are preserved across assemblies
  deconstruction of tuples into separate variables
Well, it looks like the C# language team has been busy during the last month, because both items are now implemented in VS 15 Preview 4, which was released today!</description>

      <description>A tuple is an finite ordered list of values, of possibly different types, which is used to bundle related values together without having to create a specific type to hold them.
In .NET 4.0, a set of Tuple classes has been introduced in the framework, which can be used as follows:
private static Tuple&amp;lt;int, double&amp;gt; Tally(IEnumerable&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; values) { int count = 0; double sum = 0.0; foreach (var value in values) { count++; sum += value; } return Tuple.</description>

      <description>Today I’d like to share a nice feature I discovered recently in FakeItEasy.
When you write unit tests for a class that takes dependencies, you typically need to create fake/mock dependencies and manually inject them into the SUT (System Under Test), or use a DI container to register the fake dependencies and construct the SUT. This is a bit tedious, and a few months ago I came up with an auto-mocking Unity extension to make it easier.</description>

      <description>Async programming in C# used to be hard; thanks to .NET 4’s Task Parallel Library and C# 5’s async/await feature, it has become fairly easy, and as a result, is becoming much more common. At the same time, a standardized approach to cancellation has been introduced : cancellation tokens. The basic idea is that you create a CancellationTokenSource that controls the cancellation, and pass the token it provides to the method that you want to be able to cancel.</description>

      <description>Async code is a great way to keep your app’s UI responsive. You can start an async operation from the UI thread, await it without blocking the UI thread, and naturally resume on the UI thread when it’s done. This is a very powerful feature, and most of the time you don’t even need to think about it; it “just works”. However, this works only if the async operation is started from a thread that has a synchronization context (such as the UI thread in Windows Forms, WPF or WinRT).</description>

      <title>[WPF] Prevent the user from pasting an image in a RichTextBox</title>

      <description>WPF’s RichTextBox control is quite powerful, and very handy if you need to accept rich text input. However, one of its features can become an issue: the user can paste an image. Depending on what you intend to do with the text entered by the user, you might not want that.
When I googled for a way to prevent that, the only solutions I found suggested to intercept the Ctrl-V keystroke, and swallow the event if the clipboard contains an image.</description>

Consider this piece of code :
Console.WriteLine($&amp;quot;x &amp;gt; y is {x &amp;gt; y}&amp;quot;);Console.WriteLine($&amp;quot;!(x &amp;lt;= y) is {!(x &amp;lt;= y)}&amp;quot;);How would you declare and initialize x and y for the program to produce the following, apparently illogical, output?
x &amp;gt; y is False!(x &amp;lt;= y) is True</description>

      <description>SQLite is a nice in-process database engine: it’s very lightweight, doesn’t require any server or configuration, and runs on all platforms. There is even an official ADO.NET provider that’s very well made. However, if you store dates as UTC with this provider, you will probably encounter a serious issue: even though the date is properly stored as UTC (it’s stored in a form similar to ISO8601, with a ‘Z’ to indicate the UTC timezone), when you read it back from the database, you will get a DateTime converted to local time, with Kind = Unspecified.</description>

      <description>Unit testing can be tedious sometimes, especially when testing classes that have complex dependencies. Fortunately, some tools make it somewhat easier. I’ve been using FakeItEasy a lot recently; it’s a very easy to use mocking framework for .NET. It has a very lean and simple API based on generics and lambda expressions, and is a real pleasure to work with. It came as a breath of fresh air compared to the old RhinoMocks I had been using before.</description>

      <title>Async and cancellation support for wait handles</title>

      <guid>https://thomaslevesque.com/2015/06/04/async-and-cancellation-support-for-wait-handles/</guid>
      <description>The .NET framework comes with a number of low-level synchronization primitives. The most commonly used are collectively known as “wait handles”, and inherit the WaitHandle class: Semaphore, Mutex, AutoResetEvent and ManualResetEvent. These classes have been there since at least .NET 2.0 (1.1 for some of them), but they haven’t evolved much since they were introduced, which means they don’t support common features that were introduced later. In particular, they don’t provide support for waiting asynchronously, nor do they support cancelling the wait.</description>

I just came up with this one:
static void Test(out int x, out int y){x = 42;y = 123;Console.WriteLine (x == y);}What do you think this code prints? Can you be sure? Post your answer in the comments!
I’ll try to post more puzzles in the future if I can come up with others.</description>

      <description>Recently, my team and I started writing unit tests on an application that uses a lot of async code. We used NUnit (2.6) because we were already familiar with it, but we had never tried it on async code yet.
Let’s assume the system under test is this very interesting Calculator class:
 public class Calculator{public async Task&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; AddAsync(int x, int y){// simulate long calculationawait Task.</description>

      <description>The ToArray and ToList extension methods are convenient ways to eagerly materialize an enumerable sequence (e.g. a Linq query) into an array or a list. However, there’s something that bothers me: both of these methods are very inefficient if they don’t know the number of elements in the sequence (which is almost always the case when you use them on a Linq query). Let’s focus on ToArray for now (ToList has a few differences, but the principle is mostly the same).</description>

      <description>If you write an application that has anything to do with file management, you will probably need to display the size of the files. But if a file has a size of 123456789 bytes, it doesn’t mean that you should just display this value to the user, because it’s hard to read, and the user usually doesn’t need 1-byte precision. Instead, you will write something like 118 MB.
This should be a no-brainer, but there are actually a number of different ways to display byte sizes… For instance, there are several co-existing conventions for units and prefixes:</description>

      <description>Asynchrony in C# 5 is awesome, and I’ve been using it a lot since it was introduced. But there are few annoying limitations; for instance, you cannot pass parameters by reference (ref or out) to an asynchronous method. There are good reasons for that; the most obvious is that if you pass a local variable by reference, it is stored on the stack, but the current stack won’t remain available during the whole execution of the async method (only until the first await), so the location of the variable won’t exist anymore.</description>

      <guid>https://thomaslevesque.com/2014/11/02/easy-unit-testing-of-null-argument-validation/</guid>
      <description>When unit testing a method, one of the things to test is argument validation : for instance, ensure that the method throws a ArgumentNullException when a null argument is passed for a parameter that isn’t allowed to be null. Writing this kind of test is very easy, but it’s also a tedious and repetitive task, especially if the method has many parameters… So I wrote a method that automates part of this task: it tries to pass null for each of the specified arguments, and asserts that the method throws an ArgumentNullException.</description>

The SearchBox control was introduced in Windows 8.1 to enable search scenarios from within a Windows Store app. One of its features is that it can show suggestions based on user input. There are three kinds of suggestions:
 History suggestions are search queries previously entered by the user.</description>

It’s often useful to be notified when the value of a dependency property changes; many controls expose events for that purpose, but it’s not always the case. For instance, recently I was trying to detect when the Content property of a ContentControl changed.</description>

      <description>Regardless of the programming language you&amp;rsquo;re using, there are tasks for which the most natural implementation uses a recursive algorithm (even if it&amp;rsquo;s not always the optimal solution). The trouble with the recursive approach is that it can use a lot of space on the stack: when you reach a certain recursion depth, the memory allocated for the thread stack runs out, and you get a stack overflow error that usually terminates the process (StackOverflowException in .</description>

      <description>As you probably know, incorrect usage of events is one of the main causes for memory leaks in .NET applications : an event keeps references to its listener objects (through a delegate), which prevents the garbage collector from collecting them when they&amp;rsquo;re not used anymore. This is especially true of static events, because the references are kept for all the lifetime of the application. If the application often adds handlers to the event and never removes them, the memory usage will grow as long as the application runs, until no more memory is available.</description>

You just need to get the value of xx.Foo.Bar.Baz.Name, but you have to test every intermediate object to ensure that it&amp;rsquo;s not null.

The problem It&amp;rsquo;s very common in C# programs to have an object that owns a collection of child items with a reference to their parent. For instance, this is the case for Windows Forms controls, which have a collection of child controls (Controls), and a reference to their parent control (Parent).</description>
