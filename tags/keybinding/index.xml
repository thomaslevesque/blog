      <description>THE feature that was missing from WPF ! Visual Studio 2010 beta 2 has been released last week, and it brings to WPF a long awaited feature : support for bindings in InputBindings. As a reminder, the issue in previous releases was that the Command property of the InputBinding class wasn&#39;t a DependencyProperty, so it wasn&#39;t possible to bind it. Furthermore, InputBindings didn&#39;t inherit the parent DataContext, which made it difficult to provide alternative implementations&amp;hellip; Until now, in order to bind the Command of a KeyBinding or MouseBinding to a property of the DataContext, we had to resort to clumsy workarounds&amp;hellip; I had eventually came up with an acceptable solution, described in this post, but I wasn&#39;t really satisfied with it (it used reflection on private members, and had annoying limitations).</description>

      <description>If you develop WPF applications according to the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, you may have faced this issue : in XAML, how to bind a key or mouse gesture to a ViewModel command ? The obvious and intuitive approach would be this one :
&amp;lt;UserControl.InputBindings&amp;gt; &amp;lt;KeyBinding Modifiers=&amp;#34;Control&amp;#34; Key=&amp;#34;E&amp;#34; Command=&amp;#34;{Binding EditCommand}&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/UserControl.InputBindings&amp;gt; Unfortunately, this code doesn&#39;t work, for two reasons :
 The Command property is not a dependency property, so you cannot assign it through binding InputBindings are not part of the logical or visual tree of the control, so they don&#39;t inherit the DataContext  A solution would be to create the InputBindings in the code-behind, but in the MVVM pattern we usually prefer to avoid this&amp;hellip; I spent a long time looking for alternative solutions to do this in XAML, but most of them are quite complex and unintuitive.</description>
