      <description>My blog has been a bit quiet in the last 18 months or so, because, well, life happened&amp;hellip; In that time span I became a father, changed jobs twice, and relocated to Canada with my family, so free time has been scarce. Anyway, I recently ran into a problem that I found worthy of a blog post, and I have a bit of time to write!&#xA;Heterogenous JSON formats Let&amp;rsquo;s say we&amp;rsquo;re building an ASP.</description>

      <description>In the previous post in this series, we noticed that the strongly-typed id was serialized to JSON in an unexpected way:&#xA;{ &amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;value&amp;#34;: 1 }, &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Apple&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;unitPrice&amp;#34;: 0.8 } When you think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s not really unexpected: the strongly-typed id is a &amp;ldquo;complex&amp;rdquo; object, not a primitive type, so it makes sense that it&amp;rsquo;s serialized as an object. But it&amp;rsquo;s clearly not what we wantâ€¦ Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to fix that.</description>
