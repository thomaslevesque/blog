      <description>.NET 6.0 and C# 10 are just around the corner, so now is a good time to review some of the most interesting new language features!
Record structs ðŸ“„ Proposal
Records were introduced in C# 9 as a simple way to define data types with value equality semantics, for instance:

Since I have seen little or nothing written about those, I thought I would make a list of what I noticed so far.</description>
