      <description>As a C# developer, there are obviously a lot of skills you need to master to be effective: language syntax, framework classes, third-party libraries, databases, regular expressions, the HTTP protocol, etc. But there are a handful of things that I consider to be really fundamental, and I often see C# developers, even experienced ones, who don&amp;rsquo;t master them. So, I&amp;rsquo;m doing a series about those things! Today: hash codes.
The GetHashCode method OK, I realize that most developers don&amp;rsquo;t need to implement their own hash table, or even implement GetHashCode very often, but still, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know about this.</description>
